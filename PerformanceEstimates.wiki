#summary Performance estimates for isapi_wsgi

As Graham Dumpleton, the author of [http://www.modwsgi.org mod_wsgi] [http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/PerformanceEstimates points out] "Providing benchmarks comparing one system to another is always dangerous, especially when they use different technologies. This is because the performance can be dependent on how the system is setup or tested and what the hardware configuration and operating system used is."
