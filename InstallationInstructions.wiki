=ISAPI_WSGI 0.4.1=

This document relates the current version of the isapi_wsgi handler released in April 2010.

==Dependencies==

    * Python 2.3+
    * Python win32 extensions that include the isapi package
    * wsgiref library from http://cvs.eby-sarna.com/wsgiref/ (included in Python 2.5+)
    * A windows webserver that supports ISAPI (isapi_wsgi has been tested on IIS 5.1, 6.0 and 7.0) 

==Installation==

Python 2.3 or better is required. 

Get isapi-wsgi using any of these methods:

     * from [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/isapi_wsgi/ PyPi]
     * easy_install isapi_wsgi
     * Download the archive or windows installer from [http://code.google.com/p/isapi-wsgi/downloads/list here]

If you downloaded the archive, to install, just unpack it, go to the directory containing 'setup.py', and run:

python setup.py install

isapi_wsgi.py will be installed in the 'site-packages' directory of your Python installation. (Unless directed elsewhere; see the "Installing Python Modules" section of the Python manuals for details on customizing installation locations, etc.).

(Note: for the Win32 installer release, just run the .exe file.)

==Testing==

As a user with admin privileges run the command:

{{{
python isapi_wsgi.py install
}}}

to create a simple ISAPI test extension in an IIS virtual directory called isapi-wsgi-test. This can be accessed from a webbrowser using the url:

http://localhost/isapi-wsgi-test/

If there are no errors and a simple web page is displayed, then the installation of isap_wsgi was successful.

To remove the test virtual directory, run the command:

{{{
python isapi_wsgi.py remove
}}}
