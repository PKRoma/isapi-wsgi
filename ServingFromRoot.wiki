#summary Serving a WSGI app from IIS root

==Serving a WSGI app from IIS root==

The mount point for an isapi wsgi app is normally the virtual directory name. But since isap_wsgi 0.4 it is possible to serve the application from IIS root. It is as simple as setting virtual directory parameter name to /

{{{
    vd = VirtualDirParameters(Name="/",
                              Description = "ISAPI-WSGI serve from root demo",
                              ScriptMaps = sm,
                              ScriptMapUpdate = "replace"
                              )
}}}
